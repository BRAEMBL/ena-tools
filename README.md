Description
===========

This repository has scripts for helping users generate XML files with metadata about their genomic sequences that they want to submit to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). See the script serialise_study.pl in the scripts directory.

It also provides scripts that can be useful when preparing bam files as supporting evidence for submitting annotated transcript assemblies. The scripts are in scripts/samtools.
